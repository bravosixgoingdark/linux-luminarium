Most of the time, modifying permissions is done with the `chmod` command.

The basic usage for chmod is:
```
chmod [options] mode file
```

`mode` is where you want to set the permissions of the target file. It can either be symbolic (u+rwx) or numeric (755, 644). 

In this challenge, you will need to `chmod` the file to a user-readable permission so that the you can read the `/flag`!
